Moasic JS
=========
[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/badges.svg)](https://github.com/maraisr/mosaic.js)

Delaunay triangulation shaded, from a light source based on mouse cursor. [SEE ME IN ACTION](http://marais.io). Written with TypeScript using [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) for the ES6 to ES5 passed through [Rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/). At the moment there is no API because GCC is being annoying with its Advanced Optimizations.
