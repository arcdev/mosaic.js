Mosaic JS
=========
[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/mosaic.js.svg)](https://github.com/maraisr/mosaic.js)

Real time Delaunay triangulation! Shaded, shaped and plotted! [Live Demo](http://marais.io). Written in TypeScript, for the strict sexiness it offers. Uses [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) compilation passed through [Rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/) for the tree shaking love they offer. Sadly at the moment there is no API because GCC is being annoying with its "Advanced Optimization's".
